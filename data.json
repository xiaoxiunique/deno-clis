Completely free. All we ask is that you don‚Äôt claim them as your own, and share this resource with others.\n\nWe also have some fiat currencies: `USD`, `GBP`, `EUR`, `JPY`, `CNY`, `RUB`. *(We don't intend to add more)*\n\nImages are in the PNG format (transparent) in `32√ó32`, `32√ó32 (@2x)`, and `128√ó128` variants, along with SVG versions.\n\nThere's also a [`generic` icon](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/blob/master/svg/color/generic.svg) that can be used for cryptocurrencies missing an icon here.\n\nIf there is an altcoin you‚Äôre looking for that hasn‚Äôt been included, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/issues/new?assignees=&labels=coin+request&template=add-currency.md&title=Add+Currency+%28Symbol%29).<br><sub>(We don't accept pull request contributions for new or updated icons at this time. Open an issue and we'll do the icon for you.)</sub>\n\n\n## Install üöÄ\n\n```\n$ npm install cryptocurrency-icons\n```\n\nYou can then import the icons from `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons`, for example `./node_modules/cryptocurrency-icons/svg/color/kmd.svg`.\n\nThere's also a `manifest.json` file included in the package with a list of the currency symbol, the name of the icons and the associated colors.\n\n\n## Special Thanks üëè\n\nThanks to [Christopher Downer](https://github.com/cjdowner) for starting this project and all our wonderful [contributors](https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/graphs/contributors).\n\n\n## Used By\n\n- [vue-cryptoicon](https://github.com/man15h/vue-cryptoicon) - Cryptocurrency icons for Vue apps\n- [svelte-cryptoicon](https://github.com/alepop/svelte-cryptoicon) - Cryptocurrency icons for Svelte apps\n- [Crypto Tools](http://bunchoftext.com/apps/crypto-calculator) - Cryptocurrency icons for Crypto Tools macOS app\n- [Cryptocurrency Ticker](https://cryptocurrencyticker.xyz) - Cryptocurrency ticker for Windows and Linux Mint - Cinnamon\n- [Spot](http://spot-bitcoin.com) - Cryptocurrency wallet\n\n<sub>We're always happy to see where, and how these icons are used.
